This repo is created to practise git workflow and commands.

The first task is to create .gitignore and README.MD files and commit the changes.

Followed by that I have created 3 subdirectories and 3 files within each subdirectory and commited this action as "Added boilerplate files".

Then modified a file in one of the sub-directory and commited as Modified fileA.

Furthermore, created this empty repo in Github and using its link, created this repo as remote - fetched this remote repo and pushed the local changes into this remote repo.

Now, in the github verified that the local changes are pushed into the github repo and gone through the commit history. MOving on, I have modified this README file and commiting in Github. Afterwards, I will check the commit history as remote repo in my local Git bash.
